## What is the difference between rhubarb-cli, rhubarb_lipsync, and rhubarb_lipsync_ng?

The engine used to recognize the phonemes and convert them to the 9 mouth cue types is
Daniel Wolf's [Rhubarb Lip Sync application](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync). 
The add-on ships this CLI ( command line interface) application as part of the installation zip file in the bin folder.

The **rhubarb lipsync NG** is a complete rework of the original [rhubarb lipsync addon](https://github.com/scaredyfish/blender-rhubarb-lipsync) based on the same principles and ideas.

## What does the NG stands for
The `NG` in the name stands for `Next generation`. This is to distinguish this reworked addon from the original one.
