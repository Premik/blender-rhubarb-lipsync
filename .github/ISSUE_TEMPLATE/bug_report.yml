        ðŸ’¡ Check the [Troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).

        ðŸ’¡ Start Blender in debug mode from the command line: `blender --debug`. This will make the addon log messages with maximal verbosity, possibly giving more clues about the issue.

        ðŸ’¡ On Windows, go to the main menu: `Window/Toggle System Console` to open the console window.

        ðŸ’¡ You can make the plugin write logs directly to a file:
              - Go to the main menu: `Edit/Preferences/Add-ons`.
              - Find and expand `Animation: Rhubarb Lipsync NG`.
              - Set `Log File` to file-path. For example, `C:\temp\rhubarb.log`.
